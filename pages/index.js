            <p>
              As long as I can remember, I've loved technology. My grandmother worked at Southern Bell (which through time transformed into what we know as AT&T) and loved adopting new technology and learning in general. I guess I have her to thank for my inquisitive nature. She taught me how to how to use a computer before I could tie my shoes (that's not an exaggeration) and from there it was history. From explaining to my parents as a nine year old that we needed a new graphics card for vertex shaders or installing Windows 7 with 1GB of RAM, I was probably a bit of a nuisance. Nonetheless, I think it's paid off in the long run.

              For the longest time I was the extended family's tech support agent, with anything from data transfers and OS installations to replacing routers and virus removal. Over time, my "clientele" grew and before I knew it I was performing break-fix work for a large group of family friends, acquantances and even our neighbor. I taught myself a bit of graphic design and then taught my high school "Intro to modern computing" classmates how to use <span className="text-emerald-700">Photoshop</span>, <span className="text-emerald-700">Illustrator</span> and <span className="text-emerald-700">Premiere Pro.</span>
